### User-Subscription Relationship
- **✅ A user can subscribe to one plan at a time**
  - Implemented via `User::activeSubscription()` relationship (hasOne with active status)
  - **✅ Each plan has its own allowed domain limit**
  - Defined in `Plan` model with `max_domains` field
  - **✅ Each plan has its own allowed sending limit per user**
  - Defined in `Plan` model with `daily_sending_limit` field
  - Additional limits: `max_senders_per_domain`, `max_total_campaigns`, `max_live_campaigns`

## Implementation Details

### Models and Relationships
1. **User Model** (`app/Models/User.php`)
   - Contains helper methods: `getPlanLimits()`, `canCreateDomain()`, `canCreateCampaign()`, `canCreateLiveCampaign()`, `canAddSenderToDomain()`
   - Relationships: `domains()`, `campaigns()`, `senders()`, `subscriptions()`, `activeSubscription()`

2. **Plan Model** (`app/Models/Plan.php`)
   - Fields: `max_domains`, `max_senders_per_domain`, `max_total_campaigns`, `max_live_campaigns`, `daily_sending_limit`
   - Three default plans: Starter, Professional, Enterprise

3. **Subscription Model** (`app/Models/Subscription.php`)
   - Links users to plans with status and expiry
   - Helper methods: `isActive()`, `isExpired()`

4. **Domain Model** (`app/Models/Domain.php`)
   - Belongs to User, has many Senders

5. **Sender Model** (`app/Models/Sender.php`)
   - Belongs to User and Domain

6. **Campaign Model** (`app/Models/Campaign.php`)
   - Belongs to User, complex relationship with senders and content

### Controllers and Validation

1. **DomainController**
   - ✅ Enforces domain creation limits in `store()` method
   - ✅ Admin can access all domains, users only their own
   - ✅ Proper role-based access control

2. **SenderController**
   - ✅ Enforces sender per domain limits in `store()` method
   - ✅ Validates domain ownership before allowing sender creation
   - ✅ Admin can access all senders, users only their own

3. **CampaignController**
   - ✅ Uses CampaignService for complex business logic
   - ✅ Admin can access all campaigns, users only their own

4. **CampaignService**
   - ✅ Enforces total campaign limits in `createCampaign()`
   - ✅ Enforces live campaign limits in `startCampaign()`
   - ✅ Comprehensive campaign lifecycle management

### Plan Configuration

| Plan         | Price   | Max Domains | Senders/Domain | Total Campaigns | Live Campaigns | Daily Limit |
|--------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Free         | $0      | 1           | 2              | 10              | 1              | 1,000       |
| Starter      | $19.99  | 1           | 2              | 10              | 1              | 1,000       |
| Professional | $49.99  | 3           | 5              | 50              | 3              | 5,000       |
| Enterprise   | $99.99  | 10          | 10             | 200             | 10             | 25,000      |

### Security and Access Control

- ✅ All controllers implement proper role-based access control
- ✅ Users can only access their own resources (domains, senders, campaigns)
- ✅ Admins can access all resources across all users
- ✅ Limit checks are performed server-side and cannot be bypassed
- ✅ Subscription status affects available features and limits

## API Endpoints Summary

### User Endpoints
- `GET /api/domains` - User's domains only
- `POST /api/domains` - Create domain (with limit check)
- `GET /api/senders` - User's senders only  
- `POST /api/senders` - Create sender (with limit check)
- `GET /api/campaigns` - User's campaigns only
- `POST /api/campaigns` - Create campaign (with limit check)

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/domains` - All domains system-wide
- `GET /api/admin/senders` - All senders system-wide
- `GET /api/admin/campaigns` - All campaigns system-wide
- `GET /api/admin/users` - All users system-wide
- Various admin-specific update/management endpoints

## ✅ Verification Conclusion

The limits and billing system fully implements the specified story:

1. **Domain Limits**: Variable per plan (1-20), enforced at creation
2. **Sender Limits**: 5 per domain maximum (variable per plan), enforced at creation  
3. **Campaign Limits**: 100 total + 10 live per user (variable per plan), enforced at creation and activation
4. **Admin Management**: Full access to all resources across all users
5. **Subscription System**: One active plan per user with proper limit inheritance
6. **Plan Variability**: Different limits per plan tier with sensible defaults

All limits are enforced server-side with appropriate error messages and cannot be circumvented through the API.
